                Within Enterprise applications at Fifth Third, I led all user experience and user interfaces efforts over the past year within several major projects. One of these projects was aimed at creating an external facing API portal for the bank. During this time, we conducted major competitive and user research around API portals and API integration. The end product was a fully fleshed out release plan with three phases, wireframes, site maps, style guides, branding resources, etc supplied for each phase.

                      <p>For this project, I was approached by one of my enterprise product teams with the desire of wanting to build an API portal for others to leverage. This would be the first externally facing product the enterprise team would have ever implemented. The target users initially were developers implementing products/applications that would require leveraging a banking API (for example, if a product wanted to leverage certain transactional functionality, they would be able to go to this portal in order to call the API and build it into their application). As far as other requirements went, it was fairly open-ended with just the general idea of an API portal.</p>

                      <p>As the project was fairly ambiguous, my first step was to look through competitor portals to see what was generally involved with the design and usability of a banking API portal. I targeted several different portals and was able to establish a general structure most of them followed as well as what each of them offered in terms of information/functionality. As I moved through each competitor, it did bring up a question we hadn't considered before which was if we wanted to put up some kind of registration gate. For some competitors, they utilized a registration gate to hide all of their API documentation, while others didn't and just left the information open to the public.</p>
                      <p>While going through competitor portals, I was having discussions with my developers around what they had been looking at as reference and discovered that we did have a pre-existing API portal that we had never pushed to the public. With access to that portal, I did my own heuristic analysis to see where usability could be improved as well as worked towards comparing our pre-existing portal to the competitors analyzed previously.</p>

                      <p>Initially, there were no plans to interview users as the original timeline was much tighter than what it was adjusted to being. User interviews were introduced once we discovered we had more time as the API was being written (and because I bugged my product team to let me as I wanted to gather more information on functionality and previous experiences before continuing with a design).</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>The first round of user interviews were conducted virtually in-person with 10 different CEOs/CTOS/engineering managers from different companies that were partnered with Fifth Third. They were recruited via the product team after explaining the concept we were planning on designing out. Interviews were 60 minute sessions focused around previous experiences, expectations for an API portal, components they liked/disliked from portals they've used/their devs have used, what they were hoping for with this new portal, etc.</li>
                        <li>The second round of user interviews were also conducted virtually in-person with 10 different software engineers who had experience actually implementing banking APIs in products they had either currently or previously worked on. Similar to the first round of interviews, these users also had 60 minute sessions focused around previous experiences, expectations for an API portal, components they liked/disliked from portals they've used/their devs have used, what they were hoping for with this new portal, etc, though with some more technically oriented questions that would be more relevant to them.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>From these interviews, I was able to synthesize my results and present my findings to my product and engineering teams, providing what I recommended as the direction we go in with the portal. We all came to a consensus on the direction and moved forward to the next steps.</p>

                      <p>With enough insights, I started off by creating a low fidelity version of the screens for the application as well as a site map of those screens. With those screens designed, I then created flows for each phase we had decided on for the portal, adding to the site map to show what gets added where during each phase. The site map also acted as the information architecture for the layout of the API portal.</p>
                      <p>Because of a shift in priorities for myself as well as key engineering resources, there were no further design iterations for this project. I ended up delivering a fully fleshed out release plan with three phases, wireframes, site maps, style guides, branding resources, etc supplied for each phase to my developers with the short time left I had to dedicate to the project before moving on. I also made sure they knew they could always message me with design questions as the portal got implemented, I just couldn't be a dedicated resource anymore as other projects had higher priority.</p>
