              <p>
                As part of my ongoing leadership within the Plex Discover product team, I spearheaded UX strategy and research for the development of Plex’s show tracking feature, designed to allow users to monitor their movie and TV show progress across all streaming platforms within the Plex ecosystem. This feature aimed to consolidate fragmented viewing experiences into a single, intuitive interface, especially for non-PMS users juggling multiple services. My role focused on defining a seamless, scalable UX strategy supported by low-fidelity wireframes and extensive user validation. The project is currently in beta testing, with user feedback informing iterative improvements across platforms.

                      <p>Show tracking was a product-proposed project. The team wanted a way for users to easily track their watching progress of TV shows and movies across all streaming services (including Plex titles) within Plex. This project added functionality to a new feature on Plex called Discover. Discover is a feature where a user is able to select all the streaming services they have available to themselves and, once set, gives them the ability to browse titles across all of these services as well as Plex's curated selection. Discover is a feature majorly popular among general, non-PMS users and this ended up being our target audience for this project.</p>
                      <p>Though this feature would eventually be available on all platforms (mobile, web, TV), the main platform focused at the start was web. Working with Product off an original concept flow they created, we knew we wanted to focus on the Watchlist feature and figuring out how tracking would work when a user clicks on Watchlist from the show/season/episode levels of TV shows as well as on a movie title.</p>

                    <div class="card-body">
                      <p>After the initial meeting with stakeholders, I worked collaboratively with Product as I thought through different iterations of the concept flow they created. One of the challenges that needed to be considered when working on these flows was the expected behavior between deep-linking and non-deep-linking clients. Depending on the devices and service, some services (such as Firestick/Amazon) did not allow for deep-linking which would change the flow slightly for users on that platform in order to allow the Plex app to be published on that platform.</p>
                      <p>Another major challenge was just how much granularity to include as well as the numerous flows for each episode. At the time, Plex could only support going to the show level and, based on previous user research, users expressed interest in being able to track season and episode-level content. This challenge was also intertwined with the amount of flows. Movies had the simplest flows as a user has either watched a movie or they hadn't watched a movie. TV shows were different; to start, a user could have only watched one season of a multi-season show or a few episodes from different seasons, etc. It would depend on if a TV show was sequential or if it was more of an anthology-type show where each episode was its own complete story (or something in-between those two). To compensate for this, we had flows for a user who has watched all the seasons/episodes of a show, a user who has watched none of a show, and a user who has watched some of the show. Because of the complexity, this added to the debate of what level of granularity to get down into for tracking purposes.</p>
                      <p>Eventually, we were able to get to a happy point with watchlisting and the flow was passed off to the lead UI designer for high fidelity mockups.</p>

                      <p>As the high fidelity mockups were reviewed by the team, Product had decided to also include Mark as Watched to the flows as well as Watchlist and Mark as Watched would have tied together functionality. As we got further in the Mark as Watched wireframes and started to test and prototype with users and internal employees, it did become obvious that the Mark as Watched flow did get confusing and it was eventually benched for the time being to focused just on Watchlist as well as Continue Watching improvements, which were a result from initial Watchlist wires and were very intertwined as well</p>
                      <p>Wires and high fidelity mockups were eventually created for the entirety of flows for mobile, web, and TV, with usability testing being conducted in between to confirm flows and terminology with users along the way. For a full feature release for internal employees, Show Tracking was available on mobile for testing purposes.</p>
