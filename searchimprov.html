              <p>
                Focused on the Discover product team at Plex, I led a majority of the UX strategy and research efforts over the past couple years. One of the major projects for this team was centered around Plex’s Discover feature, which allows a user to search and browse across all their streaming services in one place. In addition to show tracking, search improvements were done in conjunction in order to better serve both PMS and non-PMS users with more relevant search results. A majority of the project focused around low fidelity wireframes across platforms to fine tune an intuitive process. The search improvements created from this project are in current state Plex.

                  Because PMS users have a lot more functionality than non-PMS users do with search, it was important to map out flows for each user type and make sure the design didn’t look wonky when all PMS features were not displayed.

                      <p>The need for this project came from consistent feedback we had been getting from users about how search wasn't the greatest. Some of the feedback from users included the following:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Users wanted more functionality such as genre search</li>
                        <li>Users thought that the results given weren't that relevant to what they had originally searched for</li>
                        <li>Users thought some of the text wasn't readable and that the posters were too small</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>Search is a major feature for Plex, not just because search is important for any streaming service, but also because Plex had universal search; you're able to search across your personal media content, Plex's content, and content from all other streaming services on the market. My product manager approached me to help evaluate and improve search and so, search improvements started.</p>
                      <p>We had a fairly clear baseline of what we wanted to do based off of user feedback, but starting off, my product team and I decided to focus mainly on our web platforms (Plex has two web platforms: watch.plex.tv and app.plex.tv). Feature-wise, we wanted to focus on genre search, search results display (both for quick search and full page results), and filtering.</p>

                      <p>In order to establish a baseline of what search is like across platforms, I did a competitive analysis of 10 different streaming services to figure out the similarities and differences between search functionality on their web apps as well as their TV apps (TV would be the next focus after we had a firm blueprint for web). Once I had a good understanding of the baseline search functionality, I met with Product to see if there was anything in particular that they liked/didn't like from competitors that we could incorporate into our version of search.</p>
                      <p>From establishing that baseline, I did my own due diligence of mapping out the current state search for Plex to understand if there were any inconsistencies, the areas where users were fumbling/unhappy with, and overall, all the features that we currently had that we needed to decide if we needed to carry over or get rid of because we didn't have enough usage of them for users to find them valuable.</p>

                    <div class="card-body">
                      <p>I started out by breaking apart the flow into four pieces: quick search, quick search results, full page results, and filtering on full page results (from previous user research, it was decided that we would remove filtering from quick search as 95% of users completely ignored it, the other 5% didn't ever use it, but acknowledged it existed).</p>
                      <p>Quick search and quick search results were probably the least complicated piece of the puzzle. I was able to split these into the formatting of the results of movies, TV shows (search only goes to the show level, not season or episode), and genres (new functionality) and the overall design of search/results. Full page results was a bit more difficult as current state sectioned everything out by location (i.e. Media Library (if applicable), Live TV, Live TV Tuner (if applicable), On Plex, etc) which led to a lot of scrolling, unnecessary whitespace, and segmentation of results. I ended up coming up with three variations, one with the segmentation intact and two with a condensed version of results. The condensed version of results also had the additional challenge of figuring out what to do with the poster/image previews for each item as they varied between each content type.</p>
                      <p>Filtering was the most complicated piece mainly because of 1.) the granularity of what we were capable of getting down to vs the granularity we wanted to get down to and 2.) what we wanted to be able to refine results by (i.e. genre, director, length, location, etc).</p>

                      <p>Once initial wireframes were in a good state, I reviewed them with Product, engineering, and design. We went through a few iterations before getting to a happy place and then handed designs off to the UI/UX designer I was working with on the project. As they worked on the high fidelity versions of web, I was working on the TV version of search. The web prototype would eventually be tested to confirm flow, functionality, and terminology, the results from which were applied to the TV prototype in the applicable areas.</p>
                      <p>Search improvements from this project are in current state on <a href="https://app.plex.tv">app.plex.tv</a> and on Plex's TV apps.</p>
