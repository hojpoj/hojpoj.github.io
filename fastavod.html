              <p>
                Across the Streaming Content, Personal Media, and Playback product teams at Plex, I led all UX strategy and research efforts over the past couple years. One of the major projects for these teams started when the Streaming Content team was formed. This project was to overhaul and revamp the FAST and AVOD services on Plex. During this project, I conducted multiple usability studies across FAST and AVOD services on multiple mobile, web, and TV platforms, mapped out major flows, and facilitated workshops around all UX strategy and research findings to determine action items aligned with both product and design’s goals.

                      <p>The beginning of both of these project started as a pretty ambiguous "hey, let's fix FAST/AVOD" from my product managers so the first step was to sit down and figure out the who, what, when, where, and why. I set up a meeting with my key stakeholders to figure out the problem(s) they were wanting to solve, metrics they wanted to target, any target users they had in mind, and a timeline.</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>For FAST: My product managers wanted to tackle two main problems: the lack of consistency of the FAST experience across all supported platforms (the platforms of focus ended up being iOS, Android, watch.plex (web), app.plex (web), Fire TV, Roku, and LG/Lightning. The process started with identifying what's actually happening in FAST, if it aligns with best practices in the industry, figure out how to bring it to a consistent state across platforms that users would be happy with, and then start figuring out areas of improvement for future iterations of FAST.</li>
                        <li>For AVOD: The same problems as above were identified, but for a user group, we focused a lot less on PMS users and more on general users in order to improve the experience to focus more on retention and registration.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <p>After the initial meeting with stakeholders, I went onto non-user/market research. For this round of research, I focused on trying to find any existing documentation/research/wireframes/mockups that may be able to help target inconsistencies, walking through the application on target platforms to understand and map out flows/inconsistencies, and look at competitors to understand what best practices appear to be across streaming services. This resulted in the following:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Metadata Analysis and Usability Analysis: To start tackling the consistency issues across platforms, I started off by conducting a metadata analysis for FAST/AVOD. The metadata analysis consisted of walking through each major page within the FAST/AVOD flows, wireframing them out completely (paying extra attention to the formatting and display of metadata), and then walking through to see the best way to standardize formatting across platforms. I also was able to use these wireframes to map out feature/usability inconsistencies and recommendations around them. Part of the flows for TV FAST apps is shown to the right.</li>
                        <li>Competitive Analysis: While looking through competitors, I conducted a few analyses centered around the following: metadata formatting across FAST/AVOD, general structure/flow of FAST/AVOD, and general page organization. For these analyses, I maintained a list of 11 competitors (5 direct, 6 indirect) for AVOD and a list of between 10-15 competitors for FAST (this varied based on users and functionality being considered). Direct competitors were streaming services that were free ad-supported services, indirect competitors were paid streaming services.</li>

                      <p>With the information collected from the non-user research, I wrote up a test plan for usability research across FAST/AVOD platforms.</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>For the FAST study: The target users were initially focused around non-PMS (personal media server) users that watched at least 1-2 hours of live TV on a weekly basis, not specifically on Plex, but in general. Mobile, web, and TV platforms were targeted for this study. Users were asked to walk through the way they would typically use FAST, describing anything they liked/disliked/etc and then were asked questions around their experience, their watching habits, etc at the end to understand user behavior and content consumption. The study initially had over 80 participants, with about 40-50 usable studies used for research analysis as the study was unmoderated through UserTesting.com.</li>

The study initially had over 110 participants, with a little over 60 usable studies used for research analysis as the study was unmoderated through UserTesting.com.</li>

                      <p>With all the research conducted, I put together a synthesis of my findings, also including in a JTBD persona for each study as requested by my product team. After presenting the synthesis to my product team as well as various other stakeholders, I was able to put together a brainstorming workshop to use with my stakeholders to generate new feature ideas for FAST and AVOD. From the brainstorming workshops, I took the most popular ideas and put them into a prioritization matrix and eventually a UX strategy/research/design backlog for future iterations of each flow. Below are snippets from the AVOD synthesis, brainstorming workshop, and prioritization matrix.</p>
